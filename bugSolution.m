The solution lies in carefully managing the object lifecycles.  Ensure that objects are retained only when necessary and released promptly when they're no longer needed. Use tools like Instruments to monitor memory usage and identify potential leaks. 

Here's the corrected code (bugSolution.m):
```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethodWithObject:(MyOtherClass *)otherObject {
    // Correctly manage the reference count
    otherObject = [otherObject retain];  // Retain to prevent premature deallocation
    // ... use otherObject ...
    [otherObject release]; // Release once done, prevent memory leaks
}
@end
```
The original buggy code (bug.m) might have omitted the `retain` and `release` calls, leading to inconsistent behavior.
