In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Specifically, it occurs when an object's reference count isn't properly managed, leading to premature deallocation (memory leaks) or crashes due to accessing deallocated memory. This often manifests subtly in complex scenarios involving multiple objects and asynchronous operations.  For instance, consider a situation where an object A retains object B, but object A is released before B, leaving B with a dangling pointer, which is not referenced any more by any objects and eventually gets deallocated prematurely. This can corrupt the memory location. The classic symptom is a seemingly random crash that's hard to reproduce consistently.
